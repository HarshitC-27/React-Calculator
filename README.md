# Calculator
## This project is made using React Library of Javascript
### The basic layout is as follows-
* calculator = Header + Keypad
* **header** deals with output and keypad deals with the input
* **header** also contains a navbar which is used to switch between light mode and darkmode
* **footer** deals with the output
* also, it uses system memory to store the mode last used and opens up the same mode even when the calculator is refreshed
####
### The flow goes like-> Keyboard -> handleKeyPress function -> validations for input -> calculate result -> output -> header function (to display output)
